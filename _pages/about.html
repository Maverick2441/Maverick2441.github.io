<p> Sarah Johnson is a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University, 
where she studies combustion and chemical kinetics. She works in the <a href="https://hanson.stanford.edu">High Temperature Gasdynamics Laboratory</a>
 under Professor Ron Hanson. Her research focuses on using experimental techniques, including shock tubes and laser diagnostics, to examine the
unique chemistry of select fuels under combustion conditions </p>

<p> Sarah received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Alabama in 2013 (Roll Tide!), 
with minors in history and the <a href="https://honors.ua.edu/programs/randall-research-scholars-program/">Computer-Based Honors Program</a>
 (now Randall Research Scholars). She received a Mitchell Scholarship to study for her
M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where she graduated with distinction in 2014. </p>

<p> Outside of the lab, Sarah is passionate about STEM outreach and supporting women in STEM. She has been involved in numerous STEM outreach
activities since undergrad, and has spent much of her Stanford career active in women in engineering communities, including serving as co-President of
  the <a href="https://stanfordmewomen.weebly.com/">Stanford Mechanical Engineering Women's Group</a> for two years. Sarah also likes to apply her 
scientific training to edible pursuits, enjoying tackling new and complicated baking projects whenever she can find the time. </p>
